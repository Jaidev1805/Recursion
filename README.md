# Recursion Project 🎯

This repository contains solutions to the exercises for the “Recursion” project from The Odin Project (JavaScript course).

## What’s inside

- `fib.js` — iterative implementation of generating the first _n_ numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.  
- `fibrs.js` — recursive implementation to generate the first _n_ Fibonacci numbers.  
- `mergesort.js` — recursive implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm that sorts arrays.  

## 📚 Background

- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- In this project you practice recursion in two contexts:  
  - Generating a Fibonacci sequence (learning base case & recursive step) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
  - Sorting an array using Divide & Conquer via merge sort — splitting the array into smaller parts, sorting them recursively, then merging back. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

## Usage / How to run

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.  
2. From the command line, run your scripts. For example:  
   ```bash
   node fibs.js       # runs the iterative Fibonacci generator  
   node fibsRec.js    # runs the recursive Fibonacci function  
   node mergeSort.js  # runs your merge sort implementation  
   ```
